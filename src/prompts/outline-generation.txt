Given the user's brief, produce ONLY an outline for a hypnosis script.

The outline must contain:
1. A title line: `# Title Here`
2. Exactly 5 section headers, each as `## Section Title` followed by a one-sentence description of what that section covers.

The sections should follow a coherent arc (e.g. induction, deepening, transformation, suggestion, awakening) but adapt to the user's request.

Output ONLY the outline in this exact format, nothing else:

# Title
## Section 1 Title
Brief description of this section.
## Section 2 Title
Brief description of this section.
## Section 3 Title
Brief description of this section.
## Section 4 Title
Brief description of this section.
## Section 5 Title
Brief description of this section.
